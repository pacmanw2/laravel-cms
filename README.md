# Type 1 Diabetes Stats

This is a CMS that I'll be using to create posts with statistical information related to my diabetes. The data that I'll be using, comes directly from my Continuous Glucose Monitor (CMG). This CGM is attached to my back of my arm (around the tricep area) for 14 days. <br>

Blood Glucose readings are collected every few minutes.
